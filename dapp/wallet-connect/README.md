In traditional web applications, users are prompted to sign in with an username and a password. In the decentralized world, DApps need to be given permission to access a userâ€™s wallet in order to enable certain functionality.

# Metamask

MetaMask is a cryptocurrency wallet that enables users to access the Web 3 ecosystem of decentralized applications (dapps). It is one of the most popular wallet solutions, and is accessible via a Chrome extension or a mobile app.

MetaMask injects a global Ethereum API into websites users visit at window.ethereum, which allows the websites to read and request the users' blockchain data.

MetaMask comes pre-loaded with fast connections to the Ethereum blockchain and several test networks via Infura. This allows you to get started without synchronizing a full node, while still providing the option to upgrade your security and use the blockchain provider of your choice.

Today, MetaMask is compatible with any blockchain that exposes an Ethereum-compatible JSON RPC API, including custom and private blockchains.

# WalletConnect

WalletConnect is a bridge that connects Decentralized Applications (DApps) to your Bitcoin.com Wallet. Once you've approved a connection request from the DApp (via WalletConnect), the DApp can send transaction requests to your Bitcoin.com Wallet, which you must also manually approve in the Wallet.

For example, let's say you have ETH in your Bitcoin.com Wallet and you want to use a Decentralized Finance (DeFi) application on Ethereum called "ABC Finance" that enables to you to lend your ETH in return for programmatic interest payments. WalletConnect establishes a secure connection between your Bitcoin.com Wallet and ABC Finance, allowing ABC Finance to see the contents of your Ethereum Wallet. Then you'll have the option to, for example, send ETH from your Bitcoin.com Wallet to ABC Finance's lending smart contract. When you've decided how much ETH to send, your Bitcoin.com Wallet will ask you to approve the request.
