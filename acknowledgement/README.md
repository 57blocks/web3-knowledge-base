# Acknowledgement

The knowledge base has been a lot of work, but we couldnâ€™t have done it without the passion and dedication of **our core team (Li Bin, Wang Wei, & Yang Shan)**. Once they had the idea of cherry-picking the best content for web3 to create our very own knowledge base, they just went ahead to create the framework, assign chapters, review drafts, find the host site, and finally put everything together!

We want to thank **every contributor (Zhang Shu, Martin Ma, Victor Wang, Simon Chen, Han Liang, Chen Shi, Lily Hu, Wang Wei, Li Bin, Yang Shan)** (their names shown on top of each page) for their hard work with the spirit of sharing and continuous improvement. If you have an idea of how busy they already are as web3 developers/products, you will be amazed that all the contributors as well as reviewers could even make time to create/review each chapter.

Furthermore, we want to extend special thanks towards our **web3 training organization team (Shi Chen, Liang Han, & Martha Luo)**. It is the web3 training in parallel that gathers more audience and attention for this knowledge base, and helps the knowledge base to improve as it gets more usage throughout the training.

Thank you also goes out to **our company 57Blocks**, which brings web3 opportunities to us, enables us to get our hands on these challenging projects, and also allows us to always retrospect on what we have learned and how we can benefit others by passing along these knowledge and experience.

Last but not least, We want to thank **everyone else involved in making it happen**. We will still need to use all the help we can get to continue improving this knowledge base. We could never have done it without your help!
