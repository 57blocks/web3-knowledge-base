A transaction refers to a contract, agreement, transfer, or exchange of assets between two or more parties. The asset is typically cash or property. Likewise, a blockchain transaction is nothing but data transmission across the network of computers in a blockchain system.

Todayâ€™s blockchain networks use two types of transaction models: the UTXO model and the Account/Balance model.

**The UTXO model** are almost similar to cash or coins, Bitcoin and many Bitcoin derivatives such as Bitcoin Cash, Zcash, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Dash, and more are UTXO chains.

**The Account/Balance model** is similar to a bank account or debit card. Ethereum, EOS, Tron, and Ethereum Classic are account-based chains.

In this section, we'll explore what these two types of transaction model are, what's the difference between them and also go through their pros and cons.
