# Using DeFi Protocols

Below are a few tips to follow when investing in DeFi protocols(e.g. Aave, Yearn) that need to be executed.

## Setting Up a Wallet

Before accessing DeFi protocols, the first step is to set up a cryptocurrency wallet. There are different types of wallets available, including web wallets, desktop wallets, mobile wallets, and hardware wallets. The recommended wallet type is a hardware wallet, as it provides the highest level of security. However, web wallets are the most convenient and the easiest to set up.

To set up a web wallet, follow these steps:

1. Choose a reputable wallet provider such as Metamask, MyEtherWallet, or Coinbase Wallet.
2. Create an account and choose a strong password.
3. Follow the instructions to create your wallet.
4. Save your seed phrase and store it in a safe place. If you lose your seed phrase, you may lose access to your wallet and your funds.

Once your wallet is set up, you are ready to connect to a DeFi protocol and start using it.

## Connecting to a DeFi Protocol

After setting up a cryptocurrency wallet, the next step is to connect to a DeFi protocol. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Choose a DeFi protocol that you want to use. Some popular protocols include [Uniwap](./popular-deFi-protocols/uniswap.md), [Aave](./popular-deFi-protocols/aave.md), [Yearn](./popular-deFi-protocols/yearn.md), and [Curve](./popular-deFi-protocols/curve.md).
2. Make sure that you have the required cryptocurrency to use the protocol. For example, if you want to use Uniswap, you will need to have a certain amount of Ethereum in your wallet.
3. Connect your wallet to the DeFi protocol website. Each protocol may have a different process for this, but usually, you will need to click on the "connect wallet" or "connect to wallet" button on the website and follow the instructions.
4. Once your wallet is connected, you will be able to use the DeFi protocol to swap tokens, provide liquidity to a pool, borrow and lend assets, or create stablecoins.

It is important to note that when you connect your wallet to a DeFi protocol, you are giving permission for the protocol to access your wallet and perform transactions on your behalf. Therefore, it is crucial to use a reputable protocol and to always verify the transactions before confirming them.

## Using Uniswap to Swap Tokens

Uniswap is a popular DeFi protocol that allows users to swap one ERC-20 token for another without the need for an intermediary or order book. Here's how to use Uniswap to swap tokens:

1. Connect your wallet to the Uniswap website.
2. Choose the tokens that you want to swap. For example, if you want to swap Ethereum for DAI, you would select Ethereum as the "from" token and DAI as the "to" token.
3. Enter the amount of tokens that you want to swap. Uniswap will automatically calculate the amount of the other token that you will receive based on the current exchange rate.
4. Review the transaction details and confirm the transaction.
5. Wait for the transaction to be processed. The time it takes for the transaction to be processed will depend on the network activity and gas fees.

Once the transaction is confirmed, you will receive the swapped tokens in your wallet. Uniswap charges a fee of 0.3% for each swap, which is distributed to liquidity providers on the platform.

## Providing Liquidity to a Pool

Providing liquidity to a pool is a way to earn a return on your cryptocurrency holdings in DeFi protocols. The process involves depositing pairs of tokens into a liquidity pool that facilitates trading between those tokens. Here's how to provide liquidity to a pool:

1. Choose a DeFi protocol that supports liquidity provision, such as Uniswap or Curve.
2. Determine the pair of tokens that you want to provide liquidity for. For example, you might choose to provide liquidity for the ETH/DAI pair.
3. Deposit an equal value of both tokens into the liquidity pool. For example, if you want to deposit $1,000 worth of ETH, you will also need to deposit $1,000 worth of DAI.
4. The protocol will issue you liquidity provider (LP) tokens in proportion to the amount of liquidity you provided. You can hold onto these LP tokens or trade them on secondary markets.
5. As traders swap tokens on the platform, you will earn a proportionate share of the transaction fees paid by traders in the form of additional tokens.

It's important to note that providing liquidity involves taking on some level of risk, as the value of the tokens in the pool can fluctuate. Additionally, there may be fees associated with depositing and withdrawing tokens from liquidity pools.

## Borrowing and Lending on Aave

Two popular DeFi protocols for borrowing and lending are Aave and Compound. Here's how to use these protocols to borrow and lend:

Lending:

1. Connect your wallet to either the Aave website.
2. Choose the cryptocurrency that you want to lend.
3. Approve the transaction and deposit your cryptocurrency into the protocol's smart contract.
4. Earn interest on your cryptocurrency holdings, which will be paid out to you periodically.

Borrowing:

1. Connect your wallet to either the Aave website.
2. Choose the cryptocurrency that you want to borrow.
3. Check the interest rate for the cryptocurrency you want to borrow and ensure that you have enough collateral to cover the loan.
4. Input the amount of cryptocurrency that you want to borrow and approve the transaction.
5. Receive the borrowed cryptocurrency in your wallet.

It's important to note that borrowing on these platforms involves taking on debt, which must be paid back with interest. Additionally, borrowing may require collateral in the form of cryptocurrency held in your wallet, which could be liquidated if the value of the collateral drops below a certain level.

## Earning Interest with Yearn.finance

Yearn.finance is a popular DeFi protocol that allows users to earn interest on their cryptocurrency holdings by automatically moving funds between different liquidity pools and yield farming strategies. Here's how to use Yearn.finance to earn interest:

1. Connect your wallet to the Yearn.finance website.
2. Choose the cryptocurrency that you want to deposit.
3. Select the vault that you want to deposit your cryptocurrency in. Vaults are automated yield farming strategies that are managed by Yearn.finance.
4. Approve the transaction and deposit your cryptocurrency into the selected vault.
5. Earn interest on your cryptocurrency holdings, which will be paid out to you periodically.

Yearn.finance uses a strategy of moving funds between different DeFi protocols to maximize yield opportunities. As such, the interest rates on your deposited cryptocurrency may change over time. Additionally, the Yearn.finance platform charges a small fee for using its services, which is distributed to the platform's governance token holders.
