# Yearn Finance

## What is Yearn.finance?

[Yearn.finance](https://yearn.finance) is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that aims to help users optimize their cryptocurrency investment returns.The initial goal of Yearn was to achieve higher investment returns through automated collateralized lending and arbitrage strategies. It is a suite of smart contracts and applications that enable users to automate the management of their digital asset portfolios. The core component of Yearn is yVaults, a set of smart contracts that can automatically optimize for the best yield.

## How does it work?

Yearn.finance's yVaults automate the process of searching for the best yield by pooling together funds from multiple liquidity sources, such as decentralized exchanges and lending protocols. The yVaults then use strategies such as yield farming, liquidity provision, and other DeFi protocols to maximize returns on the pooled funds. The protocol is governed by the YFI token, which is used for voting on governance proposals and receiving a share of the protocol's fees.

## Yearn Vaults

The Yearn vaults, also known as yVaults, are one of the key features of the Yearn.finance protocol. Some of the features of the yVaults include:

- **Automated yield optimization**: The yVaults automatically seek out the highest yield available in the DeFi ecosystem, allowing users to earn the best possible returns on their investment.

- **Diversification**: The yVaults invest in multiple DeFi protocols, allowing users to diversify their investments and reduce risk.

- **Passive income**: The yVaults generate passive income for users, as the smart contracts automatically reinvest the yield generated by the investments.

- **Flexibility**: The yVaults allow users to easily move their funds between different pools, giving them flexibility in how they manage their digital asset portfolio.

- **Low fees**: The yVaults have low fees compared to traditional investment vehicles, making it more accessible to small investors.

## What are the benefits?

Yearn provides a number of benefits to its users, including:

- **Automated portfolio management**: Yearn's yVaults automate the process of optimizing for the best yield, saving users time and effort.

- **Maximizing returns**: By pooling funds from multiple sources and using automated strategies, Yearn is able to maximize investment returns.

- **Decentralized governance**: The protocol is governed by the YFI token, which allows for decentralized decision-making and ensures that the protocol is owned and controlled by its users.

- **Secure**: Yearn is built on the Ethereum blockchain, which provides a high level of security and transparency.

## What are the risks?

- **Smart contract risk**: Yearn is built on smart contracts, which are computer programs that execute automatically. If there are errors or vulnerabilities in the smart contracts, it could result in the loss of funds.

- **Market risk**: Like any investment, the value of cryptocurrency can be volatile and subject to market fluctuations. There is a risk that the value of the cryptocurrencies held by Yearn could decline, resulting in a loss of value for users.

- **Liquidity risk**: Yearn relies on liquidity from other DeFi protocols, such as decentralized exchanges and lending platforms. If there is a sudden loss of liquidity in these protocols, it could result in a loss of funds for Yearn users.

- **Governance risk**: Yearn is governed by the YFI token, which allows for decentralized decision-making. However, there is a risk that the governance process could be influenced by a small group of token holders or that proposals could be poorly designed or executed.
