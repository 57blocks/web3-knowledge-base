## Overview

For desktop users, you may use Metamask, a web browser extension available  on Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Brave browsers. Like Argent, Metamask is  a non-custodial wallet and acts as both a wallet and an interaction bridge for  the Ethereum network. It should be noted that Metamask also has an app  for mobile phones. However, the app may have difficulties interacting with  Dapps as some Dapps are not optimized for mobile devices.

You can store your Ethereum and ERC20 tokens on Metamask. Acting as  an interaction bridge, Metamask enables you to use all Decentralized  Applications (Dapps) hosted on the Ethereum Network.

Without the use of an interaction bridge like MetaMask, your browser would  not be able to access the Ethereum blockchain unless you were running a  full Ethereum node and had the entire Ethereum blockchain of over 400GB  downloaded on your computer. On a technical level, MetaMask does this by  injecting a javascript library known as web3.js written by the core Ethereum  developers into your browserâ€™s page to enable you to interact with the  Ethereum network easily.

Metamask makes interaction with DeFi Dapps on the Ethereum network  very convenient on your laptop or PC. They are secured to some degree as  it requires you to sign each interaction and transaction you execute on the  network. Metamask also has an in-built token swap feature, which allows you  to exchange other tokens directly from the wallet.

However, it would be best if you took precautions to keep your Metamask  safe and secure. Anybody who has your password or seed phrase (a secret  phrase given to you during wallet sign-up) will have complete control of your  wallet.
