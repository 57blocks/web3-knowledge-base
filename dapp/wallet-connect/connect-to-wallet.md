## Web3-Onboard

Web3-Onboard is the quickest and easiest way to add multi-wallet and multi-chain support to your project. With built-in modules for more than 35 unique hardware and software wallets, Web3-Onboard saves you time and headaches.

Features:

1. Minimal Dependencies - All wallet dependencies are included in separate packages, so you only include the ones you want to use in your app
2. Multiple Wallets and Accounts Connection, Multichain Support - Allow your users to connect multiple wallets and multiple accounts within each wallet at the same time to your app. Let users switch between chains/networks with ease. ALL EVM networks supported
3. Unified Provider Interface - All wallet modules expose a provider that is patched to be compliant with the EIP-1193, EIP-1102, EIP-3085 and EIP-3326 specifications. Whether your user is using Ledger or Metamask the provider will operate identically
4. Dynamic Imports - Supporting multiple wallets in your app requires a lot of dependencies. Onboard dynamically imports a wallet and its dependencies only when the user selects it, so that minimal bandwidth is used
5. Framework Agnostic - Avoid framework lock in -- Web3-Onboard works with any framework and includes helper packages for vue & react
6. Account Center - An interface to manage wallet connections and networks, with a minimal version for mobile
7. Notify - Real-time transaction notifications for all transaction states for the connected wallet address(es). In-notification speedups & cancels for hardware wallet connections
